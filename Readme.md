note : all names can be change in Metabase translation.

#### Update Syncing

Go to the Update Metabase Syncing Panel

![SyncingAndScanMetabase](docs/images/syncing_scan_metabase.png)

By default, Metabase does a lightweight hourly sync and an intensive daily scan of field values. 
If you have a large database, you should modify syncing option.

##### Database syncing
This is a lightweight process that checks for updates to this databaseâ€™s schema. 
In most cases, you should be fine leaving this set to sync hourly.

##### Scanning for Filter Values
Metabase can scan the values present in each field in this database to enable checkbox filters in dashboards and questions. 
This can be a somewhat resource-intensive process, particularly if you have a very large database.

##### Periodically refingerprint tables
This enables Metabase to scan for additional field values during syncs allowing smarter behavior, 
like improved auto-binning on your bar charts.

Syncing option :
1. Full Syncing : Activate Syncing and Scan
2. On Demand : Activate Syncing and Scan on the new Filter Value
3. Syncing Only : Scan is not activated
